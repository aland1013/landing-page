Hey there!

Getting started with a simple landing page here. Feel free to jump in.

Using a serverless distro through Netlify. It rebuilds automatically based on the /dist folder on the master branch.

Production Build: 
https://lexdao.netlify.com -> We probably want to redirect .club to this eventually, but can do that through Netlify as well.
Source -> /dist on master branch

Test:
https://lexdao-test.netlify.com
Sourace -> /dist on test branch
